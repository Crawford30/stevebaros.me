I finally migrated this site to [GitHub Pages](//pages.github.com) using [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com).

> Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator". Example Jekyll websites.

Over time, I grew to really dislike how heavy-weight other CMS platform is. I dislike how WYSIWYG editors make it really hard to see what HTML is being generated and tend to bloat the code that is produced. I found different CMS platform uses more and more plugins which make the site weight heavy and slow. In CMS platform, I was not able to do more of what I want to do.

So when I came to learned about Jekyll, I found out that it is the great alternative. I like the idea that my entire blog is a set of static files. Besides its simplicity and light weighted, it makes backups so much easier and avoids most common security concerns caused by running dynamic websites. I could even write my post in [Markdown](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [Textile](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)) which is the easiest way of writing post.

I think this is the future of blogging in 21st century with Jekyll which gives great control of our contents.
