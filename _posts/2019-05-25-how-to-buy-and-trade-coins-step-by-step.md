To start trading you have to start by buying some BTC ([Bitcoin](bitcoin.org)), LTC( Litecoin), or ETH (Ethereum). I recommend Ethereum for faster transactions and low fees but still Bitcoin is the easiest to get.

1.  If you don’t have any coins yet, go to Coinbase for those in US and [Bitpesa](https://www.mybfx.co/login) for those in Africa and create a new account. Use your Credit Card or Other payment options available for instant transfer and then buy Bitcoin or Ethereum. You can transfer more later .
2.  Now go to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18798827) and create a new account.
3.  Transfer your Ethereum (or other) from Coinbase to your [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18798827) account. (goto Binance <funds>, <deposit/withdrawals>, select ETH coin <deposit>,copy your address, go back to Coin base, <accounts>, ETH wallet <send>, paste your address from [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=18798827), enter amount, send, done) .
4.  Now exchange your Ethereum to EOS (EOS), XRP (Ripple), TRX (Tron), ADA (Cardano), IOTA (IOTA), NANO(NANO), Stellar (XLM), NEO (NEO) or any other coin you like. (see tradable coins on Binance [here](https://www.binance.com/)).
5.  Done. Enjoy your new acquired coins and chase your bulls and bears.
