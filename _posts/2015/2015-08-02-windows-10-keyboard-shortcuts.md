Here's the list of Windows 10 shortcuts, and --- in addition --- some of the favorite "old but gold" shortcuts known from previous versions of Windows:

| Windows 10 keyboard shortcut | Description                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Win                          | Show the Windows 10 Start Menu                    |
| Win + Tab                    | Launch Windows 10 *Task View*                     |
| Win + Q                      | Search the web and Windows with Cortana (speech)  |
| Win + S                      | Search the web and Windows with Cortana (keyboard input) |
| Win + I                      | Open Windows 10 settings                          |
| Win + A                      | Open Windows 10 notifications                     |
| Win + L                      | Lock your Windows 10 device                       |
| Win + Ctrl + D               | Create new virtual desktop                        |
| Win + Ctrl + F4              | Close current virtual desktop                     |
| Win + Ctrl + [Left][Right]   | Switch between virtual desktops                   |
| Win + [Left][Right][Up][Down] | Position windows on your screen <br> E.g. *Win + [Left]* moves the current window to the left half of your screen. If you use *Win + [Up]* afterwards, the current window will be placed in the upper left quarter of your screen. <br> And, what's very handy in my opinion: If you release the Win key after positioning a window, Task View shows up on the opposite side of the positioned window to select and position another app. |
| Win + H                      | Share content (if supported by current app)       |
| Win + K                      | Connect to wireless displays and audio devices    |
| Win + X                      | Open *Start* button context menu
| Win + G                      | Opens the Windows 10 *Game Bar* to take game screenshots and record gaming videos of Windows 10 games (works in any game app, e.g. *Microsoft Solitaire Collection*) |

And, of course, these "old but gold" shortcuts known from previous Windows versions still work:

| Windows 10 keyboard shortcut | Description                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Win + D                      | Show Windows desktop                              |
| Win + E                      | Open *Windows Explorer*                           |
| Win + Space                  | Switch keyboard input language (if you have added at least a second one) |
| Win + Shift + [Left][Right]  | Move current Window from one monitor to another (when using a multiple monitor setup) |
| Win + [1][2][3][...]         | Open programs that are pinned to task bar <br> E.g. if first pinned program on your task bar is Windows Explorer (from left to right), the shortcut *Win + 1* opens *Windows Explorer* for you. |
| Win + R                      | Run a command                                     |
| Win + P                      | Project a screen                                  |
| Alt + Tab                    | Switch to previous window                         |
| Alt + Space                  | Restore, move, size, minimize, maximize or close current window. Also works like a charm for Windows 10 modern apps. |
| Alt + F4                     | a) Close current window <br> b) If you're on your Windows 10 desktop, open Power dialogue to shut down or restart Windows, put your device in sleep mode, sign out or switch the current user |
