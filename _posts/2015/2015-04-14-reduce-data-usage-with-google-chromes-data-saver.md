If you've ever been frustrated by exceeding your data plan on a monthly basis, popular web browser Google Chrome may just have a solution for you.

### Chrome's Data Saver extension on desktop

Google recently launched (on March 23) a new Chrome browser extension named [Data Saver](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/data-saver-beta/pfmgfdlgomnbgkofeojodiodmgpgmkac) (currently in beta at the time of writing this post) that reduces your data usage.[^more_info]

Google's data compression proxy service not only save the user bandwidth, but also load pages faster, and increase security (since sites go through Google's servers, the company checks for malicious webpages) on your phone, tablet and desktop computer.

Google describes the Data Saver extension as,

> Reduces data usage by using Google servers to optimize pages you visit. Browse more for less!
>
> When this extension is enabled, Chrome will use Google servers to compress pages you visit before downloading them. SSL and incognito pages will not be included.

Thus, the extension uses Google's data compression proxy service to optimize pages before serving them to your browser. It doesn't work with SSL and incognito pages at present, and you'll need Chrome 41 or newer to use it.

The extension gets to work as soon as you install it. You can click the extension button on your browser toolbar to see how much data it has saved you and turn it off if necessary.

Google began testing its data compression service for browsers back in March 2013. The rollout of this beta extension could point to the feature being baked into future versions of Chrome.

#### Other alternative on desktop

Since long time there's an unofficial experimental [Data Compression Proxy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/data-compression-proxy/ajfiodhbiellfpcjjedhmmmpeeaebmep) extension alternative bringing Chrome Data Compression Proxy from mobile to desktop PCs available on Chrome Web Store. Data Compression Proxy also have the feature of ad blocking and a bypass list, which you can customize in options.

### Chrome's Data Saver on mobile

Chrome's Data Saver feature is also available in Chrome on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/chrome-web-browser-by-google/id535886823?mt=8). To enable it, hop into Settings, tap Data Saver and turn it on.
