Hello, my name is Milan Aryal (मिलन अर्याल)[^name] and I'm a student living in Kathmandu, Nepal who loves getting lost in web design, front-end development, and listening music a lot.

[^name]: The name Milan (pronounced MEE-lahn), means dear, loving and gracious in Slavic; in Ancient Roman, eager and laborious; and in Sanskrit, unification. :blush:

Writing articles is hard, but making up designs is fun. I made this site so I would be able to do both.[^design]

[^design]: If I have an idea I can't sleep until I make it real. Design is my passion.

Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the results are far from my ideal expectations, I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely enthralling.

I'd like to think that I'm very happy person, but I find the art that strikes me truest is the sad, depressing sort, I love hip-hop and R&B music, post-apocalyptic fiction, and movie trailers that can make me squirt tears in under two minutes. Go figure. :wink:
