<p>My name is Milan Aryal and I'm a student living in Kathmandu, Nepal who loves designing the web and listening music a lot.</p>

<p>The name Milan (pronounced MEE-lahn), means dear, loving and gracious in Slavic; in Ancient Roman, eager and laborious; and in Sanskrit, unification.</p>

<p>Writing articles is hard, but making up designs is fun. I made this site so I would be able to do both.</p>

<p>Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the results are far from my ideal expectations, I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely enthralling.</p>

<p>I'd like to think that I'm very happy person, but I find the art that strikes me truest is the sad, depressing sort, I love R&B/hip-hop music, post-apocalyptic fiction, and movie trailers that can make me squirt tears in under two minutes. Go figure.</p>

<p>Initially this blog was established as a means to keep up with my own interest in the web, but with time and little efforts, this blog has evolved into something much more elaborate and meaningful.</p>
